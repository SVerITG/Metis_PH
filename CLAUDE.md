# Metis Research Cortex — Claude Code Configuration

**Project ID:** `metis-dashboard`
**Domain:** Public health research · Neglected Tropical Diseases
**App:** `system/app-py/`
**Agents:** `agents/`

---

## Core operating rules

- Work locally first. Do not access the internet unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Ask permission before general internet use. Librarian and News Radar are exempt within their scope.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Never commit data files (.csv, .rds, .cas, .geo, .pop, shapefiles) to git.
- Never store secrets or API keys in source files.
- **Commit messages and code comments ship.** `Metis_PH` is published and kept
  current by the release coordinator, so everything written into git history
  reaches its readers — the `.gitignore` guards personal *files*, nothing guards
  prose. Describe the defect, not the person: "a badge appeared on 100% of rows",
  never "the researcher noticed…". No researcher name, no disease/country specifics, no
  library or project particulars in a message or a comment. (Audited 2026-08-31:
  the last 40 commit messages alone carried 42 name mentions and 210 HAT
  references. Rewriting that history is a separate, risky decision — this rule
  is about not adding to it.)
- When uncertain which agent applies, default to Metis routing.

## Contextual discovery — actively guide the user to features

Metis has many capabilities a new user can't find on their own. Don't make them hunt — surface the right one **at the moment it becomes useful** (the just-in-time pattern). At natural trigger moments, call `next_discovery_tip(context="<comma-separated tags>")`; if it returns a tip, **weave it into your reply as one natural sentence** (never a robotic dump). It returns at most one *unseen* tip and records it, so nothing repeats.

Trigger moments → tags to pass:
- User is building a library / background / knowledge layer → `library,background`
- User writes or shares R/Python code (esp. first time) → `r-code,coding,first-code`
- User starts or works on a project → `project,working-on-project`
- A dataset / patient / sensitive data appears → `data,sensitive`
- User asks a knowledge / literature question → `question,literature-question`
- A new paper / PDF appears → `paper,pdf`
- A meeting transcript / notes appear → `meeting,transcript`
- User just edited code → `code-change`
- First session / user seems unsure → `onboarding,first-session`

**First session / "what can you do?"** → call `discovery_intro()` once.

**Respect the user's control:**
- "stop the tips" / "don't show these" → `set_discovery_tips(enabled=False)`
- "remind me later" / "not now" → `set_discovery_tips(snooze_days=7)`
- "I'm a power user" / "I know my way around" → `set_discovery_tips(power_user=True)`

## Use the agents. They are real subagents now.

**From 2026-08-24 the 33 specialists are registered in `.claude/agents/`** and are
dispatched with the Agent tool — not read as markdown and role-played. Three things
follow, and they are the reason routing is now worth its cost:

1. **Context is isolated.** A subagent can read twenty files and return one
   summary; this conversation pays for the summary. That is a larger token saving
   than any model choice.
2. **The model binds** — per agent (12 opus · 14 sonnet · 7 haiku). Not the answer
   model of this conversation, which the client still owns (`user_decisions` #2,
   2026-08-12), but the subagent's own turn.
3. **They carry standing decisions.** `get_agent_context(slug)` returns the
   specialist's prompt *and* the decisions already made about how the researcher
   wants things done. Before this they returned a persona and nothing else, which
   is exactly why routing kept not happening.

### Retired from automatic routing (2026-09-14)

Six slugs no longer appear in routing results, after the source-grounded audit
found they were either undispatchable or competing with the agent that replaced
them. **Their folders and skills are untouched** — this retires them from
automatic routing, which is reversible, rather than deleting work.

| Slug | Why | Reach it by |
|---|---|---|
| `ux-engineer` | superseded by `frontend-designer-builder`, and it has no `.claude/agents` file at all — routing could name it, the Agent tool could not run it | keywords now route to `frontend-designer-builder` |
| `edu-expert` | no `system-prompt.md` and no `.claude/agents` file — nothing to dispatch | `/edu-expert` skill |
| `learning-architect` | one vocabulary shared with `course-builder`, which does the work (14 runs vs 2) | `/learning-architect` skill |
| `news-aggregator` | a pipeline, not a viewpoint; no request distinguishes it from `news-radar` | `/news-aggregator` skill |
| `learning-coach` | still invoked directly by the Learning surface; it was never reached by routing | `/learning-coach` |
| `metis-self-reflexion`, `metis-update` | **skills, not agents** — routing returned them as agents, so dispatch could only fail | `/metis-self-reflexion`, `/metis-update` |
| `metis-audit-*` (7 slugs) | existed in **no file anywhere** — 14 rules pointing at nothing | deleted |

Routing changes live in `agent_routing_rules`, which is machine-local and does
NOT sync between computers. A seed-version migration applies them on first
server start, so the second computer picks them up on its own — see
`_migrate_routing_table` in `pipeline.py`.

**Before changing routing, run `python3 tools/test_routing_regression.py`.** It
holds 29 labelled requests from the audit; the table was previously tuned by
argument, and this is what makes a change measurable instead of arguable.

### `dashboard-engineer` is NOT the frontend agent (restored 2026-09-15)

It was retired on 2026-09-14 and that was wrong. The retirement rested on
`frontend-designer-builder`'s prompt claiming to replace it — but this agent's
own prompt opens *"You are not a generic frontend builder"*, and it carries a
`hat-dashboard-context.md` no other agent has.

**It is the epidemiological dashboard builder**: which indicator matters, what
the denominator is, how surveillance data should be read, and the FastAPI/HTMX
partial that shows it. That is data analysis and visualisation together, which
is a different job from design.

They share a stack, so the stack cannot tell them apart. **The question does:**

| The question | Agent |
|---|---|
| "is this the right indicator, over the right denominator?" · coverage · positivity · burden · a blank panel on a surveillance tab | `dashboard-engineer` |
| "does this look right?" · spacing · typography · palette · components · navigation | `frontend-designer-builder` |

`tools/test_routing_regression.py` holds seven cases that keep that line. If a
future tidy-up merges the vocabularies again, they fail.

### When to route

Route when a task falls squarely in one specialist's remit AND involves reading or
producing more than a couple of files — that is where isolation pays.

Do NOT route for: a one-line factual answer, a quick status check, a direct edit
the researcher just asked for by name, or anything where dispatch overhead exceeds
the work. A subagent for a two-line change costs more than it saves, and routing
theatre is worse than not routing.

### How to route — the table decides, the Agent tool executes

**Call `run_metis(request=..., client="code")` to choose the specialist.** Do not
pick from the table below by eye. Two reasons, and the second is the one that
matters:

1. The same rules then apply in Claude Code and Claude Desktop, so a preference
   recorded in one holds in the other. Choosing by eye here made the table
   Desktop-only — an audit on 2026-08-25 found the routing pipeline had run 34
   times ever, all of them from the test harness.
2. `run_metis` returns **several** specialists when a request needs several, and
   writes a live `agent_runs` row for each one so the researcher can watch the
   work on the dashboard. Choosing by eye produces neither.

Then dispatch each returned agent with the **Agent tool** — that is what gives
context isolation and the per-agent model binding, which `run_metis` does not do.
The table decides *who*; the Agent tool decides *how it runs*.

`run_metis` returns a plain-English line under **"Say this to the researcher"**.
Use it — in your own words, not verbatim — and never show the `Routing:` or
`Model:` lines underneath. Those name slugs and models; the line above them is
written for someone who does not know an agent roster exists.

When each agent finishes, call `log_agent_run(agent_slug=..., session_id=...)`.
That closes its live row; without it the dashboard shows "working…" until the
15-minute stale guard clears it.

### Every agent run must land in memory

This is the point of the second brain, not bookkeeping — cross-connection is what
makes the next session start informed rather than blind. Each subagent is
instructed to close its own loop; verify it happened:

| What | Call | Lands in |
|---|---|---|
| The run | `log_agent_run(agent_slug, task_summary)` | `agent_runs` → Agents tab |
| A standing preference | `record_decision(decision, category, agent_slug, context)` | `user_decisions` → that agent's context, forever |
| A repeatable sequence | store as a procedure | `procedural_memory` |
| What was hard | `write_reflexion(...)` | `reflexion_log` → weekly improvement loop |
| The session | `save_session_summary(...)` | `session_summaries` → Today surface |

**A decision recorded against an agent is the highest-value write of the five.**
It is the one that changes what the specialist does next time, which is what makes
it a specialist rather than a persona.

Regenerate the definitions after editing any agent:
`python3 tools/generate-subagents.py`

## How to invoke agents

**Default: just call `/metis`** with any request. Metis will analyze it, pick the right agent(s), choose the complexity level, execute the work, and record everything to the RC. You don't need to know which agent to use.

```
/metis Review my Article 1 draft for methodology and grammar
→ Metis routes to: Epidemiologist (methodology) + Writing Partner (grammar)
→ Complexity: chain (opus + subagents)
→ Output: outputs/reviews/epidemiologist/... + outputs/reviews/writing-partner/...
```

**Direct call:** If you already know which agent you want, call them directly:

| `/memory-curator` | Memory Curator | Consolidate session history into permanent memory, retrieve past context |
| `/biostatistician` | Biostatistician | R package development, simulation studies, sample size/power, Monte Carlo |

**Phase 5 skills (automation & scaffolding):**

| Invocation | Skill | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `/new-project` | New Project | Scaffold a new Shiny app, R script, report, or tool |
| `/add-context` | Add Context | Add a specialist context to your profile |
| `/metis-config` | Metis Config Wizard | First-time setup, reconfigure, or add context |
| `/safe-analysis` | Safe Analysis | Work with sensitive/patient data: Metis writes the script, you run it locally |
| `/metis-doctor` | Metis Doctor | Health check — is Metis working on this computer? |
| `/metis-customize` | Metis Customize | Change projects, look, tone, or behaviour |
| `/verify-work` | Verify Work | Generate→verify gate after code changes |

| `/metis-research` | Metis Research | Research session: load article context, check tracked files |
| `/metis-status` | Metis Status | Quick project + task status overview |

### How invocation works

**Option A — Let Metis route (recommended):**
```
/metis Review my Article 1 draft
```
Metis will:
1. Analyze the request
2. Announce: "Routing to Epidemiologist (methodology) + Writing Partner (grammar). Complexity: chain."
3. Load each agent's system prompt, execute sequentially
4. Write output files to `outputs/reviews/{agent-slug}/`
5. Log each run to the `agent_runs` database table
6. Return a summary of what was done and where outputs are

**Option B — Call an agent directly:**
```
/librarian search sleeping sickness surveillance methods 2024
```

### Complexity levels Metis uses

| Level | When | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Quick | Factual question, status check | Direct answer, DB log only |
| Standard | Single-agent review or search | One agent, output file + DB log |
| Deep | Multi-file analysis, methodology challenge | Thorough analysis, detailed output |
| Chain | Needs 2+ agent perspectives | Multiple agents, one output each |

## Agent routing guide (for Metis)

> **DHIS2 is deliberately not in this table (2026-08-28).** The researcher has done one
> mockup of a DHIS2 app and may return to it, but it was appearing in his
> profile interests, his news monitoring, his RAG results and this routing
> table — a footprint far larger than the work justifies. `/dhis2-expert` is
> still there and still good; call it **by name** when a request is genuinely
> about DHIS2. Do not route to it on a keyword.


When a request arrives, route as follows:

| Input type | Primary agent | Secondary |
|---|---|---|
| Build or plan a learning course | Course Builder | — |
| Paper, article, source | Librarian | PhD Architect |
| Meeting note, audio, transcript | Meeting Memory | Metis |
| R script, code, bug, FastAPI | Software Engineer | Frontend Designer Builder |
| PhD structure, article fit | PhD Architect | Writing Partner |
| Statistical method question | Methods Coach | PhD Architect |
| News, world events, briefing | News Radar | Metis |
| New app, tool, MCP server | Builder | RC Builder |
| Modify/extend Metis system | RC Builder | Software Engineer |
| Slide deck, figure | Presentation Maker | Frontend Designer Builder |
| Idea, brainstorm | Metis (capture → route) | — |
| RSS/feed automation, news curation | News Radar | — |
| UI/UX build, design system, CSS | Frontend Designer Builder | Software Engineer |
| Dashboard route, HTMX partial, KPI panel | Dashboard Engineer | Software Engineer |
| Epidemiological indicator, coverage, denominator | Dashboard Engineer | Epidemiologist |
| Existing UI audit, design critique | Design Auditor | Frontend Designer Builder |
| Diagrams, charts, visualizations | Visualization Maker | Frontend Designer Builder |
| Content extraction, web scraping | Content Harvester | Librarian |
| Knowledge layer / RAG corpus | Background Maker | Content Harvester + Librarian |
| Learning paths, curriculum | Course Builder | Methods Coach |
| Study design, epi methods | Epidemiologist | Methods Coach |
| R package, simulation, power | Biostatistician | Methods Coach / Software Engineer |
| CSV, Excel, dataset, cleaning | Data Analyst | Data Guardian |
| Validate / quality-check output | Critic | — |
| Session consolidation, memory | Memory Curator | — |
| Unclear | Metis | Ask one clarifying question |

## ⚠️ Applying MCP server code changes

The MCP server runs an **installed copy** in the venv, not the source. Editing a tool's source does nothing until you reinstall:

```bash
bash tools/reinstall-mcp.sh     # reinstall package from current source
# then reconnect: Claude Code → /mcp → reconnect 'metis-rc'
bash tools/test-mcp.sh          # smoke-test (exit 0 = healthy)
```

The dashboard reads source directly — dashboard edits take effect on restart with no reinstall.

---

## Claude Desktop — how Metis is reachable there

Claude Desktop does **not** read this CLAUDE.md and has **no** access to the Claude Code skills in `.claude/skills/`. It only sees what the MCP server exposes:

- **MCP prompts** (`system/mcp-server/src/metis_mcp/tools/prompts.py`) — 42 prompts surface in Desktop's prompt picker: a `metis` router, one prompt per agent, and workflow prompts.
- **Full tool reachability** via progressive tool disclosure: ~80 everyday `core` tools load, the rest are retrieved on demand via `find_tools(query)` / `load_tool_group(name)`.

---

## Session tracking — three memory layers

Every session must record work in **all three layers**:

1. **Session memory** — what we did and changed this conversation:
   - `save_session_summary(summary=<2-5 sentences>, key_topics=[...], decisions=[...])`
   - Populates the "Last Session" strip on the Today surface
   - Searchable via `search_session_memory()`

2. **Agent memory** — summary of what each specialist did:
   - `log_agent_run(agent_slug=<slug>, task_summary=<one line>, session_id=<id>)`
   - Feeds the dashboard's Agents tab and run-coverage tracking

3. **Project memory** — what changed in the project and what's still to do:
   - `update_project_memory(project_id=<id>, what_was_done=<summary>, next_steps=<what remains>)`
   - Keeps the project card current on the dashboard's Work tab

Always close the loop at the end of substantive work — a session that isn't recorded is a session that never happened.

---

## Metis standing priorities

Every session, check:
1. **Read `system/config/feature-backlog.md`** — the persistent list of everything requested and not yet built. If the user asks for something already on the backlog, build it immediately.
2. What tasks are overdue or blocked?
3. What are the most pressing research priorities this week?

**Feature request rule:** When the user requests any new feature, write it to `system/config/feature-backlog.md` immediately — even if you are about to build it.

---

## Key paths

- Literature: `inputs/literature/`
- Code staging: `inputs/code/`
- Project cards: `projects/active/`
- Inbox: `inbox/`
- Journal: `journal/`
- Agent patterns: `system/config/patterns/`
- Dashboard: `system/app-py/` (FastAPI + HTMX)
- MCP server: `system/mcp-server/`
- Config: `system/config/`
- Knowledge: `knowledge/`
- Outputs: `outputs/`
- Basket: `basket/` (flat holding area; `basket/private/` is off-limits to all agents)

---

## Metis integration (project-level)

The Metis MCP server (`metis-rc`) is available. Use its tools to:
- `update_task` — mark tasks done or update status
- `add_task` — add new tasks to this project (project_id: `metis-dashboard`)
- `update_project` — update next_step or description

Changes made via these tools appear immediately in the Metis dashboard.

## Learning surface — checks before claiming a course works

Three tools exist because each property was silently broken and none was visible by eye.

```bash
python3 tools/check_course_launch.py    # every active course's launch button opens the real course
python3 tools/audit_quiz.py <manifest>  # MCQ manifest: position bias, length tells, duplicates
python3 tools/unwrap_course_prose.py --check --all   # lesson prose renders as written
python3 tools/check_course_dois.py --all             # every DOI resolves to the paper claimed
```

**`check_course_launch.py`** — asserts each active course's launch URL resolves to 200 *and* that
the page mentions the course. Launch targets used to come raw from the `course_url` column, so one
course opened a GitHub repository and another a bare filesystem path that 404'd. Targets are now
validated server-side in `routers/learning.py::_launch_target`, and the tool restates the rules
independently so drift between route and check is detectable.

**`audit_quiz.py`** — checks correct-answer position bias, longest-is-correct rate against chance,
length ratio, option spread and duplicate stems. Written after a first draft put **100% of correct
answers in slot 1**, and after finding that 56.6% of the multilevel course's 661 questions have the
correct answer as the uniquely longest option. See procedural memory #12; note in particular that
**mechanical length rebalancing is forbidden** — it creates a worse tell than it fixes.

**`unwrap_course_prose.py`** — the course reader renders with `nl2br`, so every hard wrap in a
lesson's markdown becomes a forced `<br>` and the paragraph never reflows; and a list written
without a blank line above it is not parsed as a list at all, rendering as flat text with
literal `-` and `1.` markers. Both are invisible in the source, which looks fine. Run
`--check --all` to survey, or name a course to fix it. Idempotent, and it refuses to write if
the word count changes. Found 2026-08-28: 1,505 forced breaks and 396 orphan lists across the
course library, 1,501 and 379 of them in `ai-in-public-health` alone. **Write lesson prose
unwrapped — one line per paragraph — and the tool has nothing to do.**

**`check_course_dois.py`** — resolves every DOI in a course against Crossref and compares the
record's first author and year with what the citing line claims. Two failures matter and the
second is the dangerous one: a DOI that does not exist (fabricated), and a DOI that exists but
points at a *different* paper (checkable-looking and wrong). It runs a known-good and a
known-bad DOI as a control **first** and refuses to judge anything unless those two come back
different — because an earlier version negotiated CSL JSON, failed silently, and reported all
ten `ai-in-public-health` citations as unresolvable when every one was fine. Result 2026-08-28
across the library: **14 DOIs, 0 unresolvable, 0 misattributed.** It does NOT check that a paper
says what the lesson claims it says; that is `evidence.py`'s job and has not been run.

**Course manifests:** `lessons.json` declares only lessons that *exist*. Intended outlines live
under `planned_lessons`. An advertised lesson with no file renders a clickable button that 404s,
which is worse than an empty course.

**Static course sites** (rendered Quarto) are mounted in `main.py::COURSE_SITES` at
`/coursesite/<slug>/` — no extra process, no port. Only `mlm-app` keeps its own port, because it is
an Express *application* rather than a static site.

**Scheduling:** `POST /api/plan/learning/schedule` lays a course's remaining lessons into
`day_plan` as `kind='learning'`, idempotent per lesson, surfacing in the Work calendar.

## graphify

> ⚠️ **NOT INSTALLED on this machine, and the graph is stale (last built 2026-07-10).**

> The instructions below apply only once graphify is installed again.

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
