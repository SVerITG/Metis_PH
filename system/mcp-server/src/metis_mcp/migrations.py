"""
migrations.py — idempotent schema upkeep for metis.sqlite.

Runs on every MCP server startup. Each migration is a `(name, sql)` tuple,
applied via SQLite's "ADD COLUMN" / "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS" semantics
so re-runs are safe.

Why this exists: in R8 of the 2026-05-23 audit marathon, the
`brainstorm_sessions` table had drifted — the DDL in `brainstorm.py` expected
columns (title, status, synthesis, action_items) that the existing DB didn't
have, because the table had been created earlier with the legacy shape
(topic, sources_used, summary, linked_idea_ids). `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
silently skipped re-creation, so the new tool's INSERTs failed with
"no column named title". This module makes that whole class of bug impossible
on existing installs upgrading to a new Metis version.

When you add a new column to any table:
  1. Add an `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ...` entry to `MIGRATIONS` below
  2. Give it a unique `name` (used to track which migrations have run)
  3. Re-deploy — the runner will apply it once, log it, and skip on next start

When you add a new table, the table's own module should still own its
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` definition. Use this file ONLY for columns
added to existing tables.
