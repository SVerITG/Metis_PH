"""focus.py — a focus area is a LENS, not a container.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
    The researcher, 2026-08-24: the "AI in Public Health course" turned out not to be a
    course. A course has an end; an ongoing interest does not. What he actually
    wanted was a surface that stays current on one subject — news, literature,
    an overview, and somewhere to put notes and ideas — and that can be pushed
    onto a shelf while it is live and taken off again when attention moves.

THE ARCHITECTURAL DECISION THAT MATTERS
    **A focus owns no content.** It owns a definition of a query.

    Every piece of content a focus shows already lives in a table that owns it:
    news in `news_briefs`, papers in `new_publications`, thinking in `ideas` and
    `personal_notes`, documents in `pdf_chunks`. The focus contributes only the
    lens through which they are read, plus a tag (`focus:<slug>`) on anything
    written while looking through it.

    That is what makes the question "what happens when I remove it?" have a good
    answer: **removing a lens cannot remove what you saw through it.** Archiving
    a focus leaves every note, idea, paper and brief exactly where it was, still
    tagged, still searchable. Nothing is orphaned because nothing was ever owned.

    The alternative — a focus that holds copies of its items — would make removal
    a data-loss decision, and would put the same paper in two places the moment
    two focuses overlapped. That is a container. This is a lens.

WHY KEYWORD *GROUPS* AND NOT A KEYWORD LIST
    Measured while building this. A flat list for "AI in health" returned
    "An AI job boom", "Can AI ever be conscious?" — real AI news, irrelevant to
    the focus. Because the subject is not one axis, it is a CONJUNCTION: something
    about AI *and* something about health.

    So the lens is a list of groups: OR within a group, AND across groups.
    Precision went from 56 loose news matches to 7 that are all genuinely on
    subject ("FDA plans to regulate generative AI", "AI model helps clinicians
    detect heart obstruction"). Recall drops, and that is the correct trade for a
    surface you open every day — a focus feed you have to filter by eye is a feed
    you stop opening.

THE THREE STATES
    active     on the shelf, in the navbar, refreshed on schedule. Max 3, because
               a shelf with ten things on it is not a focus.
    following  defined and queryable, off the navbar. Attention has moved but the
               lens is worth keeping.
    archived   read-only, no refresh, still openable. Never deleted — the
               definition is cheap and the history is the point.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How a keyword matches
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Changed 2026-08-26, on measured evidence and with the researcher's go-ahead.
#
# THE PROBLEM. Keywords matched as bare substrings (`LIKE '%kw%'`). On his
# AI-in-health lens that made 70 of 388 briefs (18%) false positives, and the
# examples are not marginal:
#
#     'ai'  inside 'avait'        -> Sénégal: le Conseil constitutionnel…
#     'gis' inside 'enregistre'   -> Ligue 1: à Nice, l'Ivoirien Wahi…
#     'gis' inside 'radiologists' -> AI won't replace radiologists…
#
# THE RULE. A keyword must now start at a WORD BOUNDARY. It may still run into a
# longer word from there, which is what keeps a deliberate stem working:
# 'epidemi' catches epidemiology and epidemic, while 'ai' stops catching 'said'.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS, STATED PLAINLY. That third example is a real loss: "AI won't
# replace radiologists" is genuinely relevant and reached group 2 only through
# 'gis' inside 'radiologists'. A lens is a filter, and any filter tightened
# enough to remove noise removes something worth keeping. The surface therefore
# reports what the change dropped rather than quietly banking the improvement.
#
# HOW, given SQLite has no word-boundary operator: LIKE stays as a cheap,
# index-friendly first pass, and a boundary regex confirms in Python. The SQL can
# only over-return, never under-return, so the confirmation is sound.
# ── SHORT KEYWORDS ARE ACRONYMS, NOT STEMS ───────────────────────────────────
# Added 2026-09-04, on measured evidence.
#
# THE PROBLEM. The word-start rule above is deliberately generous: a keyword may
# run on into a longer word, which is what makes 'epidemi' catch epidemiology
# and epidemic. That generosity makes a two-letter keyword unusable — as a stem,
# 'ai' matches aid, AIDS, air and aim, every one of them common in global
# health. So 'ai' was never added to the AI-in-health lens at all, and the
# focus matched only the spelled-out "artificial intelligence".
#
# WHAT THAT COST, MEASURED. On 2026-09-04 the lens returned 23 of 4,103 briefs.
# Another 21 said a standalone "AI" beside a health term and were silently
# dropped — among them "World's first patient to undergo live AI-assisted brain
# surgery" and "Context-aware AI assistance reduces diagnostic error in chest
# X-ray interpretation". Both are squarely the subject of that focus, and both
# were invisible on it. A focus that misses the most common spelling of its own
# subject is not a filter, it is a leak — and the failure is silent, because a
# lens reports what it caught and never what it passed over.
#
# THE RULE. A keyword of three characters or fewer is matched as a WHOLE WORD,
# with an optional plural 's'. Longer keywords keep the word-start stem
# behaviour, unchanged. The mode is chosen by the shape of the keyword, so no
# stored lens needs re-authoring.
#
#     'ai'  -> \bai(?:s)?\b   matches "AI", "AIs", "AI-assisted" (a hyphen is a
#                             word boundary); rejects aid, AIDS, air, aim.
#     'llm' -> \bllm(?:s)?\b  matches "LLM", "LLMs", "LLM-based" — the only
#                             short keyword that existed when this landed, and
#                             the optional plural is what keeps it working.

# surface and notice it was empty. A lens is the entire behaviour of the surface,
# so guessing at it and finding out later is the wrong loop.

#   A conjunction returning zero tells you nothing about WHICH group is wrong. So
#   the preview reports each group alone as well as the combination. If group 1
