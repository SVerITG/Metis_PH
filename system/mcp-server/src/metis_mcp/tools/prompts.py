"""MCP prompts — make Metis routing and agents reachable in Claude Desktop.

Claude Desktop does not read CLAUDE.md and has no access to the Claude Code
skills in `.claude/skills/`. It only sees what the MCP server exposes. Tools
alone make Metis a toolbox, not an orchestrator — Desktop has no instruction
telling it to route, announce the chosen agent(s), adopt the agent persona, or
log the run.

This module closes that gap by registering MCP **prompts**. Claude Desktop
surfaces prompts in its prompt menu (the `+` / "Add from Metis" picker). Each
prompt returns an instruction block that drives the same workflow Claude Code
gets from CLAUDE.md + the skills:

  * `metis`           — master router. Calls run_metis(), states the routing
                        line, loads + adopts the chosen agent(s), logs the run.
  * one per agent     — e.g. `epidemiologist`, `librarian` … loads that agent's
                        system prompt via get_agent_context() and adopts it.
  * workflow prompts  — morning briefing, research session, capture, handoff,
                        weekly — the high-traffic Code skills, mirrored.

Registration is defensive: a malformed agent folder is skipped, never fatal.
The module is loaded by server.py exactly like a tool module.
