# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# TWO SEPARATE FEED LISTS, because News and Library are different jobs.
#
# NEWS_FEEDS   → news_briefs      → the News surface
# LIBRARY_FEEDS → new_publications → the Library surface
#
# The distinction is not "health vs science", it is **journalism vs primary
# literature**:
#
#   News is reporting that PICKED UP a result — Guardian Science on a Lancet
#   paper, ScienceDaily on a new model, STAT on a trial readout. It is what
#   happened, and what the world is saying about it.
#
#   Library is the primary literature itself — journal tables-of-contents and
#   preprint servers. It exists to build a scientific background, not to tell you
#   the news, and it is scanned on the Library's schedule, not the News one.
#
# Mixing them was a recurring bug: journal ToCs landed in news_briefs and the
# relevance ranking PROMOTED them to the lead, because a paper is by definition
# closer to a researcher's corpus than a headline. Separate lists make that
# structurally impossible rather than a filter someone has to remember.
#
# EVERY URL BELOW WAS VERIFIED LIVE ON 2026-08-19: parsed, non-empty, and recent.
# Never add one unverified — feedparser returns an EMPTY RESULT rather than
# raising on a 404, so a bad URL fails silently and looks like a quiet news day
# forever. 24 of the 52 feeds in the version before this were dead, some for
# years. `check_news_feeds` exists to catch exactly that.
