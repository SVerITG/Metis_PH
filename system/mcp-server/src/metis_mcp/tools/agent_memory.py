"""agent_memory.py — what makes invoking a specialist worth doing.

THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
    2026-08-24, the researcher: *"I don't see them mentioned in the outputs, where
    are my agents? ... if you are not using them they must not be good?"*

    The agents are not bad. They hold no memory, and that is a different problem
    with a different fix.

    Measured that day: `user_decisions` held **2 rows** while `session_summaries`
    held **7,578 decision entries**. Every decision the researcher ever made was
    written somewhere nothing reads — the same write-path-with-no-reader defect
    this project keeps finding, and the most consequential instance of it.

    The consequence is precisely the behaviour the researcher noticed. Invoking
    `frontend-designer-builder` returned a persona that could be inferred from its
    name. It did NOT return "the researcher wants a visual options studio with
    clickable mini-previews" or "position:fixed, to escape overflow clipping" —
    decisions actually taken, recorded in a session summary, and unreachable. So
    routing cost tokens and added nothing, and an assistant with any judgement
    stops routing. **The agent system was not being under-used; it was empty.**

WHAT A DECISION IS HERE
    A STANDING PREFERENCE, attributed to the specialist that should apply it:

      frontend-designer-builder  how a dashboard gets built
      writing-partner            how prose gets written
      librarian                  what matters in the library
      software-engineer          how code gets structured

    Not an open question — `open_decisions` already holds those, with a lifecycle.
    Not a fact — `semantic_memory` holds those. A standing preference has no
    lifecycle: it applies until superseded, and `supersedes` records that rather
    than deleting the history.

    `agent_slug = ''` means it applies to every agent — a project-wide rule.

WHY ATTRIBUTION AND NOT ONE FLAT LIST
    A flat list of 200 preferences injected into every agent is noise, and noise
    gets ignored. The Librarian does not need CSS decisions. Attribution is what
    keeps the injected context short enough to be read, which is the only thing
    that makes it change behaviour.
