| **Standard** | Dashboard + MCP + hooks | Default install for most researchers | `standard` |

| **Full without R** | Full minus R/RStudio | For non-R users who still want all content | `full-no-r` |

## Course inclusion logic

Installer asks: `"Include the Biostatistics for Epidemiologists course? (~50 MB, 12 lessons)"`

- If **yes** → copy `knowledge/courses/biostatistics/` to install path, seed `learning_courses` row
- If **no** → skip. The user can ask for a course to be built at any time.

Placeholder courses (14 rows in `learning_courses`) are always included — they are DB records only, no file content.
