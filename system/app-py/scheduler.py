scheduler.py — APScheduler background jobs for the Metis dashboard.

Jobs registered here run automatically on their cron schedules when the
dashboard is running. They are the same operations as the manual scan
buttons — APScheduler just calls them without user interaction.

Default schedule (all overridable via user-config.yaml → jobs: section):
  morning_scan           09:00 daily — news feeds + PubMed + OpenAlex
  library_index          09:05 daily — library file inventory
  inbox_process          09:10 daily — process pending inbox items
  literature_discovery   Mon 09:15   — PubMed + OpenAlex paper discovery by topic
  brief_synthesis        09:20 daily — pre-generate AI morning brief (runs AFTER scans)
  dataset_monitor        09:30 daily — check data triggers, fire if conditions met
  board_refresh          Mon 09:35   — Events & Funding boards via web search
  evening_reflexion      09:40 daily — aggregate reflexions for self-improvement
  memory_consolidation   09:45 daily — distil recent agent runs into memory_entries
  weekly_summary         Mon 09:50   — generate weekly summary
  nightly_backup         09:55 daily — copy metis.sqlite to backups/

    WHY THIS JOB EXISTS
        `scan_library_feeds()` — the function that reads the journal and preprint
        table-of-contents feeds — had NO SCHEDULED CALLER anywhere in the repo.
        `job_morning_scan` calls `scan_news_feeds` and `scan_literature_folder`,
        and reports the latter as "Lit: N items", which reads like the literature
        feeds ran when in fact it counted new PDFs in a local folder. So the
        surface said "Lit: 0" every morning and looked like a quiet week in the
        journals, while 21 healthy feeds were simply never being read. The last
        rows in new_publications came from a hand-run scan.

        That is the mirror image of the write-path-with-no-reader bug already
        recorded in this codebase: a reader with no caller. Both are invisible by
        eye, because the surface still renders and still shows old data.

    WHAT "SEARCHED UPON UPDATE" MEANS HERE
        the researcher asked that all sources be searched on update, so this job covers all
        three routes literature can arrive by, and reports them separately:
          1. Journal + preprint feeds  → new_publications  (breadth, no query)
          2. Zotero                    → literature_metadata (his own catalogue)
          3. PubMed + OpenAlex         → new_publications  (targeted by topic)

        Zotero belongs in this job rather than on a button: it had gone THREE
        MONTHS without a sync (last 2026-05-21) because a manual button is only
        pressed by someone who already suspects it is stale.

    Each route is independently guarded. A publisher 403 must not stop the Zotero
    sync, and a missing Zotero key must not stop the feeds.
