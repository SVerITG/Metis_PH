"""focus.py — the dashboard surface for a focus area.

ONE TEMPLATE, MANY SURFACES
    Every other surface in Metis is a bespoke template: `today.html`,
    `knowledge.html`, `work.html`. A focus surface cannot work that way — the
    whole point is that the researcher adds and removes them himself, and a surface that
    needs a developer to exist is not a surface a user can add.

    So there is exactly one template, driven by one row. `/focus/ai-in-health-
    epidemiology` and `/focus/anything-else` render the same file against
    different data. That is what makes "custom pages a user can add or remove"
    a real feature rather than a promise.

THE FIVE COMPONENTS
    Taken from what the researcher asked for, and each one reads a table that already owns
    its rows — the focus writes no copies:

      pulse     what is new since the last visit, and how stale the feed is
      overview  the standing narrative — the orientation that survives the feed
      feed      news through the lens              (news_briefs)
      reading   literature through the lens        (new_publications)
      thinking  notes and ideas written here       (personal_notes, ideas)

    `pulse` is first on purpose. Opening a focus you have not seen for a week,
    the first question is "what happened", not "what is this".

# ── WHICH SECTIONS A FOCUS SHOWS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# Until 2026-09-03 every focus rendered the same nine sections, because the first
# focus was about AI and the template grew around it. The researcher put it
# plainly: "Every shelf is different. There is no safe, brief, what changed, your
# thinking" — a reference focus wants its tools and what is new, not a place to
# accumulate verdicts.
#
# So the shape is data now. `focus_areas.sections` is a JSON list of keys in the
# order they should appear; EMPTY MEANS THE HISTORICAL DEFAULT, so a focus that
# predates this change renders exactly as it did.
DEFAULT_SECTIONS = ["pulse", "overview", "safe", "brief", "thinking", "feed", "reading"]

# ── THE BRIEFING EDITIONS, READ IN PLACE ─────────────────────────────────────
# Asked for 2026-09-04: "Add the Nature Briefings from the News surface to the
# third focus on our shelf. Thumbnails, same styling as Nature, full articles
# readable."
#
# Three of those four are here. THUMBNAILS ARE NOT, and the reason is data, not
# effort: `briefing_item` carries headline, blurb, url and source and no image
# column, and the 88 briefing rows in `news_briefs` are the only ones of 4,170
# with no image_url. Getting a thumbnail means fetching each article page for
# its og:image, which is general internet access and needs asking first.
#
# "Full articles readable" is served by the blurb, which is Nature's own
# summary paragraph and is what the e-mail shows, plus the link out. The
# briefing is a digest of other people's articles; the full text lives on the
# publisher's page and is not ours to hold.

#    in the navbar, so anything taken off the shelf could be opened only by typing
#    its URL. An interest you set aside is exactly the one you will not remember
#    the slug for.
#
# The form asks for keyword GROUPS as separate fields — "must mention one of" AND
# "and one of" — rather than asking for JSON. That teaches the conjunction by
# construction, which matters because the conjunction is the one thing a user has
# to understand for the lens to behave.
