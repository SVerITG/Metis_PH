# Source ledger — AI in Public Health & Epidemics

**Read this before citing anything from this course.**

This course originally shipped with a single blanket warning — "every citation is an
unverified lead". That is honest and close to useless: it gives a reader no way to tell the
handful of sources that were actually checked from the many that were not, so it prices
everything at the level of the weakest item. This ledger grades them instead, in the same
shape as the genomic-surveillance course.

| Grade | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **CROSSREF-VERIFIED** | The DOI was resolved against Crossref and its first author and year match what the lesson claims. The citation points at the paper it says it does. |
| **MARKED-VERIFIED** | Carried an inline `✓ Verified` marker from the authoring session. The claim was checked then; no DOI is present to re-check mechanically. |
| **SEARCH** | A named reference with no DOI and no verification marker. Almost certainly a real paper; the specific volume, page or finding attributed to it was not confirmed. **Verify before citing in a manuscript.** |
| **FLAGGED** | The author flagged uncertainty inline. Treat as a lead to chase, not a citation. |

Last checked: **2026-09-05** with `tools/check_course_dois.py`.

## STANDING — verify before citing

Field knowledge stated in the lesson prose without a source: Farrington/Noufaily aberration
detection as the European routine-surveillance workhorse; the claim that tabular deep learning
reliably loses to gradient boosting; PPV collapse at low prevalence; proper scoring rules (WIS,
CRPS, log score) as the debt owed by probabilistic forecasts; EARS C1/C2/C3 provenance and
design intent. All are standard and none was re-verified while writing.

## What this ledger does not do

It does not check that a paper *says* what the lesson claims it says. A DOI matching its author
and year proves the citation points at the right paper, not that the finding attributed to it is
the finding it reports. That is the second verification layer — `evidence.py` in the MCP server —
and it has not been run over this course.

---

## Lessons 11 and 12 — the canon and the frontier (added 2026-09-05)

These two lessons are, by design, almost entirely citation. Every DOI in them was
resolved against Crossref **before** the lessons shipped, and the first author and year
of each record were compared with what the lesson line claims.

**Result: 39 DOIs across the whole course · 0 unresolvable · 0 misattributed.**

The 24 DOIs new to these two lessons are therefore all **CROSSREF-VERIFIED**:

The frontier is largely preprint literature. These carry arXiv identifiers, no DOI, and
were **not** independently adjudicated. They are widely accepted within the field; the
specific claim attributed to each was not confirmed here. Verify before citing in a

### A fix to the checker itself

`tools/check_course_dois.py` was reporting nine false mismatches, from two causes:
it read the date in an inline `✓ Verified 2026-08-21` marker as the publication year,
and it read a bolded reading-tier verdict (`**READ.**`) as the author surname. Both are
now stripped before author/year extraction. Flags fell from 9 to 1 — and the one that
remains is the documented bolded-journal-name limitation on a line whose author and year
are in fact correct.
