# Metis Research Cortex — Codex Configuration

**Project ID:** `metis-dashboard`
**Domain:** Public health research · Neglected Tropical Diseases
**App:** `system/app-py/`
**Agents:** `agents/`

---

## Core operating rules

- Work locally first. Do not access the internet unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Ask permission before general internet use. Librarian and News Radar are exempt within their scope.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Never commit data files (.csv, .rds, .cas, .geo, .pop, shapefiles) to git.
- Never store secrets or API keys in source files.
- When uncertain which agent applies, default to Metis routing.

## Contextual discovery — actively guide the user to features

Metis has many capabilities a new user can't find on their own. Don't make them hunt — surface the right one **at the moment it becomes useful** (the just-in-time pattern). At natural trigger moments, call `next_discovery_tip(context="<comma-separated tags>")`; if it returns a tip, **weave it into your reply as one natural sentence** (never a robotic dump). It returns at most one *unseen* tip and records it, so nothing repeats.

Trigger moments → tags to pass:
- User is building a library / background / knowledge layer → `library,background`
- User writes or shares R/Python code (esp. first time) → `r-code,coding,first-code`
- User starts or works on a project → `project,working-on-project`
- A dataset / patient / sensitive data appears → `data,sensitive`
- User asks a knowledge / literature question → `question,literature-question`
- A new paper / PDF appears → `paper,pdf`
- A meeting transcript / notes appear → `meeting,transcript`
- User just edited code → `code-change`
- First session / user seems unsure → `onboarding,first-session`

**First session / "what can you do?"** → call `discovery_intro()` once.

**Respect the user's control:**
- "stop the tips" / "don't show these" → `set_discovery_tips(enabled=False)`
- "remind me later" / "not now" → `set_discovery_tips(snooze_days=7)`
- "I'm a power user" / "I know my way around" → `set_discovery_tips(power_user=True)`

## How to invoke agents

**Default: just call `/metis`** with any request. Metis will analyze it, pick the right agent(s), choose the complexity level, execute the work, and record everything to the RC. You don't need to know which agent to use.

```
/metis Review my Article 1 draft for methodology and grammar
→ Metis routes to: Epidemiologist (methodology) + Writing Partner (grammar)
→ Complexity: chain (opus + subagents)
→ Output: outputs/reviews/epidemiologist/... + outputs/reviews/writing-partner/...
```

**There is nothing to type.** Each specialist is registered as a subagent and is
selected from its `description:` line against what the request is about. Say what
you need and the right one picks it up; `@agent-name` forces a particular one;
`/metis` makes the routing explicit and records it.

### How invocation works

**Option A — Let Metis route (recommended):**
```
/metis Review my Article 1 draft
```
Metis will:
1. Analyze the request
2. Announce: "Routing to Epidemiologist (methodology) + Writing Partner (grammar). Complexity: chain."
3. Load each agent's system prompt, execute sequentially
4. Write output files to `outputs/reviews/{agent-slug}/`
5. Log each run to the `agent_runs` database table
6. Return a summary of what was done and where outputs are

**Option B — just ask, and let the specialist select itself:**
```
Find recent papers on passive surveillance sensitivity, 2022 onwards.
```

**Option C — insist on one specialist:**
```
@epidemiologist is the denominator right in this coverage estimate?
```

### Complexity levels Metis uses

| Level | When | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Quick | Factual question, status check | Direct answer, DB log only |
| Standard | Single-agent review or search | One agent, output file + DB log |
| Deep | Multi-file analysis, methodology challenge | Thorough analysis, detailed output |
| Chain | Needs 2+ agent perspectives | Multiple agents, one output each |

## ⚠️ Applying MCP server code changes

The MCP server runs an **installed copy** in the venv, not the source. Editing a tool's source does nothing until you reinstall:

```bash
bash tools/reinstall-mcp.sh     # reinstall package from current source
# then reconnect: Codex → /mcp → reconnect 'metis-rc'
bash tools/test-mcp.sh          # smoke-test (exit 0 = healthy)
```

The dashboard reads source directly — dashboard edits take effect on restart with no reinstall.

## Codex Desktop — how Metis is reachable there

Codex Desktop does **not** read this AGENTS.md and has **no** access to the Codex skills in `.Codex/skills/`. It only sees what the MCP server exposes:

- **MCP prompts** (`system/mcp-server/src/metis_mcp/tools/prompts.py`) — 42 prompts surface in Desktop's prompt picker: a `metis` router, one prompt per agent, and workflow prompts.
- **Full tool reachability** via progressive tool disclosure: ~80 everyday `core` tools load, the rest are retrieved on demand via `find_tools(query)` / `load_tool_group(name)`.

---

## Session tracking — three memory layers

Every session must record work in **all three layers**:

1. **Session memory** — what we did and changed this conversation:
   - `save_session_summary(summary=<2-5 sentences>, key_topics=[...], decisions=[...])`
   - Populates the "Last Session" strip on the Today surface
   - Searchable via `search_session_memory()`

2. **Agent memory** — summary of what each specialist did:
   - `log_agent_run(agent_slug=<slug>, task_summary=<one line>, session_id=<id>)`
   - Feeds the dashboard's Agents tab and run-coverage tracking

3. **Project memory** — what changed in the project and what's still to do:
   - `update_project_memory(project_id=<id>, what_was_done=<summary>, next_steps=<what remains>)`
   - Keeps the project card current on the dashboard's Work tab

Always close the loop at the end of substantive work — a session that isn't recorded is a session that never happened.

---

## Metis standing priorities

Every session, check:
1. **Read `system/config/feature-backlog.md`** — the persistent list of everything requested and not yet built. If the user asks for something already on the backlog, build it immediately.
2. What tasks are overdue or blocked?
3. What are the most pressing research priorities this week?

**Feature request rule:** When the user requests any new feature, write it to `system/config/feature-backlog.md` immediately — even if you are about to build it.

---

## Key paths

- Literature: `inputs/literature/`
- Code staging: `inputs/code/`
- Project cards: `projects/active/`
- Inbox: `inbox/`
- Journal: `journal/`
- Agent patterns: `system/config/patterns/`
- Dashboard: `system/app-py/` (FastAPI + HTMX)
- MCP server: `system/mcp-server/`
- Config: `system/config/`
- Knowledge: `knowledge/`
- Outputs: `outputs/`
- Basket: `basket/` (flat holding area; `basket/private/` is off-limits to all agents)

---

## Metis integration (project-level)

The Metis MCP server (`metis-rc`) is available. Use its tools to:
- `update_task` — mark tasks done or update status
- `add_task` — add new tasks to this project (project_id: `metis-dashboard`)
- `update_project` — update next_step or description

Changes made via these tools appear immediately in the Metis dashboard.

## Learning surface — checks before claiming a course works

Two tools exist because both properties were silently broken and neither was visible by eye.

```bash
python3 tools/check_course_launch.py    # every active course's launch button opens the real course
python3 tools/audit_quiz.py <manifest>  # MCQ manifest: position bias, length tells, duplicates
```

**`check_course_launch.py`** — asserts each active course's launch URL resolves to 200 *and* that
the page mentions the course. Launch targets used to come raw from the `course_url` column, so one
course opened a GitHub repository and another a bare filesystem path that 404'd. Targets are now
validated server-side in `routers/learning.py::_launch_target`, and the tool restates the rules
independently so drift between route and check is detectable.

**`audit_quiz.py`** — checks correct-answer position bias, longest-is-correct rate against chance,
length ratio, option spread and duplicate stems. Written after a first draft put **100% of correct
answers in slot 1**, and after finding that 56.6% of the multilevel course's 661 questions have the
correct answer as the uniquely longest option. See procedural memory #12; note in particular that
**mechanical length rebalancing is forbidden** — it creates a worse tell than it fixes.

**Course manifests:** `lessons.json` declares only lessons that *exist*. Intended outlines live
under `planned_lessons`. An advertised lesson with no file renders a clickable button that 404s,
which is worse than an empty course.

**Static course sites** (rendered Quarto) are mounted in `main.py::COURSE_SITES` at
`/coursesite/<slug>/` — no extra process, no port. Only `mlm-app` keeps its own port, because it is
an Express *application* rather than a static site.

**Scheduling:** `POST /api/plan/learning/schedule` lays a course's remaining lessons into
`day_plan` as `kind='learning'`, idempotent per lesson, surfacing in the Work calendar.

## graphify

> ⚠️ **NOT INSTALLED on this machine, and the graph is stale (last built 2026-07-10).**
> Checked 2026-08-12: `graphify` is not at `~/.local/bin/graphify` nor anywhere on PATH.
> Two PreToolUse hooks called it on every Bash/Read/Glob and errored every time; they are
> now guarded with `command -v … || true`, so they stay silent and resume working if it is
> reinstalled.
>
> **Do not trust `graphify-out/` for codebase questions.** It predates everything built
> since mid-July — the ambient memory layer, the structural audit, the background packs,
> the Office integration. A stale graph answers confidently and wrongly, which is worse
> than no graph. Use ripgrep and the source until it is rebuilt with `graphify update .`
>
> The instructions below apply only once graphify is installed again.

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
