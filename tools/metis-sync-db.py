"""metis-sync-db.py — converge Metis's memory across two computers, safely.

THE PROBLEM
    The user works from two machines. The CODE syncs (git + the OneDrive folder), but
    the DATABASE does not: this machine's memory stopped at 8 July while the other
    had 8-13 July. Sessions, agent runs, ideas and reflexions diverged silently.

WHY THE LIVE DB IS NOT SIMPLY PUT ON ONEDRIVE
    It was, and OneDrive destroyed it (2026-06-19). A live SQLite database is
    THREE files — .sqlite, -wal, -shm — that must stay mutually consistent.
    OneDrive copied them at different instants, mid-write, and the result was a
    corrupt database. That is why the live DB was moved to the native filesystem.

    But the lesson is narrower than "SQLite and OneDrive don't mix". It is:

        ** OneDrive must never touch a file that is being WRITTEN. **

    A finished, static snapshot has no WAL and no writer. It is just bytes. That
    is provably safe on OneDrive — tools/backup-canonical.py has been doing it
    correctly all along (snapshot to /tmp via the SQLite backup API, then MOVE the
    completed file across, so OneDrive never sees a half-written database).

THE DESIGN
    live DB (local, native FS)  ──export──▶  immutable snapshot on OneDrive
                                                     │
    live DB (other machine)     ◀──merge───────────── ┘

    * The live database NEVER goes on OneDrive. That rule is unchanged.
    * OneDrive carries only finished, hostname-stamped snapshots.
    * Each machine merges the snapshots the OTHER machines left behind.
    * Convergence is eventual, and that is fine: this is memory, not a ledger.

WHY THE MERGE IS SAFE
    The tables we merge are append-only event logs. Union is the correct operation
    — there is no conflict to resolve, only rows one machine has not seen yet.

    The one real trap: every table has an autoincrement `id`, and those COLLIDE
    across machines (both have an episodic_memory id=5, meaning different things).
    So rows are identified by a CONTENT FINGERPRINT — a hash of every column
    except the local id. Merging is therefore idempotent: re-importing the same
    snapshot inserts nothing.

    Mutable, stateful tables (tasks, projects) are deliberately NOT merged. They
    would need real conflict resolution, and getting that subtly wrong is worse
    than not doing it. See SKIPPED below.

    Newly merged memory has no embedding — the nightly `embedding_backfill` job
    reconciles that automatically, so semantic recall picks the rows up on its own.

USAGE
    python3 tools/metis-sync-db.py            # export ours, merge theirs
    python3 tools/metis-sync-db.py --status   # what's out there, what's merged
    python3 tools/metis-sync-db.py --dry-run  # show what WOULD be merged
    python3 tools/metis-sync-db.py --import-only / --export-only
