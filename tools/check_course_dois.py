"""Check that every DOI in a course resolves, and points at the paper claimed.

Two different failures, and the second is the dangerous one:

  1. The DOI does not exist. A fabricated citation.
  2. The DOI exists but resolves to a DIFFERENT paper than the surrounding text
     claims. A citation that looks checkable, passes a glance, and is wrong.

Only the second needs Crossref metadata, so that is what this does: fetch the
record, compare first author and year against what the lesson line asserts.

It runs a control pair FIRST — a DOI that certainly exists and one that certainly
does not — and refuses to judge any real DOI unless those two come back different.
A checker that returns the same answer for pass and fail is decoration, and this
one has already been caught doing exactly that: an earlier version requested CSL
JSON via content negotiation, which failed silently for every DOI and reported all
ten citations in `ai-in-public-health` as unresolvable. They were all fine.
