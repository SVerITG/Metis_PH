"""generate-subagents.py — expose Metis' specialists as Claude Code subagents.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    Until now Metis' 33 specialists lived only as markdown read over MCP. That
    made "route to the Librarian" mean *read a file and role-play*, which is why
    it kept not happening: it cost tokens and delivered a persona.

    Registering them in `.claude/agents/` changes three things at once:

    1. THEY BECOME DISPATCHABLE. A real subagent, launched by the Agent tool,
       not a prompt I remembered to adopt.
    2. THE MODEL BINDS — for that subagent. This is the narrow, legitimate answer
       to a question settled on 2026-08-12 (`user_decisions` #2: "Metis does not
       make the answer's model call, the Claude client does"). That decision
       rejected server-side answer generation, and it stands. A subagent is a
       different mechanism: Claude Code still does the work, so the cost model
       does not change, but the per-agent `model` is honoured.
    3. CONTEXT IS ISOLATED — and this is the biggest token win, larger than the
       model choice. A librarian subagent can read twenty files and return one
       summary; the main conversation pays for the summary, not the twenty files.

THE DESIGN DECISION THAT MATTERS HERE
    These files are DELIBERATELY THIN — a dispatcher, not a copy of the prompt.

    The 33 agents carry ~98,000 tokens of prompt between them, and
    `methods-coach` alone is ~9,400. Inlining that would mean every subagent
    definition is a large static blob, duplicated from `agents/<slug>/`, going
    stale the moment the real prompt is edited — the two-copies-of-one-truth
    failure this project keeps paying for.

    So each generated file says: call `get_agent_context("<slug>")` first. That
    single call returns the system prompt, the contract, the project context
    files AND the standing decisions — assembled fresh, inside the subagent's own
    context window, where it is cheap.

    One source of truth (`agents/<slug>/`), loaded on demand, in isolation.

    Claude Code matches on this text, so it has to read like trigger phrases, not
    like a job title. An agent described only as "Librarian" is never selected.

    WHY THE BUDGET GREW (2026-09-21)
        The twin `.claude/skills/<slug>/` entries were removed, because none of
        them had ever been typed. That makes this line the ONLY thing that gets a
        specialist selected — there is no second door behind it any more.

        Measured at the time: 11 of the 33 descriptions were being cut at 280
        characters, and the cut always landed in the same place — it removed the
        closing "NOT for X (-> other specialist)" clause. That clause is the only
        part of the sentence that tells two neighbouring specialists apart, so the
        truncation was deleting precisely the disambiguator and keeping the
        keywords that make two agents look alike.

    SO THE CUT IS NOW BOUNDARY-AWARE
        Keep the opening (what this agent is for) and keep the closing exclusion
        (who to use instead), and shorten the trigger list in the MIDDLE. A few
        fewer example phrases costs almost nothing; losing the exclusion costs a
        wrong dispatch.

You are Metis' **{title}** specialist.

## First, load who you are

Before doing anything else, call:

```
get_agent_context("{slug}")
```

That returns your full system prompt, your contract, any project-specific context
files, and — importantly — the **standing decisions** the researcher has already
made that you are expected to apply. Adopt all of it. Do not ask for preferences
that are already recorded there.

This indirection is deliberate: your real prompt lives in `agents/{slug}/` and is
edited there. Copying it into this file would create a second copy that goes stale.

## Then do the work

Work to your contract. Ground claims in the researcher's own indexed library
rather than general knowledge where the two differ — `search_pdf_knowledge` and
`weigh_evidence` are the tools for that, and `verify_claim` checks a citation
before you rely on it.

## Before you finish — record it

This is not bookkeeping, it is the point. Metis is a second brain: work that is
not recorded did not happen, and the next session starts blind.

1. `log_agent_run(agent_slug="{slug}", task_summary="<one line>")`
2. If the researcher stated or confirmed a standing preference — how something
   should be built, written, chosen or prioritised — record it so you carry it
   next time:
   `record_decision(decision="...", category="...", agent_slug="{slug}", context="why")`
3. If you followed a repeatable sequence worth reusing, store it as a procedure.
4. `write_reflexion(...)` on deep or multi-step work: what worked, what was
   missing, which tool you wished existed.

Return your findings, not a narration of your process. Your final message is the
result the main conversation receives — it does not see your intermediate steps,
so anything that matters must be in it.
